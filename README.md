# Bedridden patient care support System

This is my **IoT Project (Prototype)**. Project that applied the use of Microcontroller, Sensor and Blynk Application to perform the following tasks...  
1. Streaming video through the app to keep an eye on the bedridden patient.
2. Set timer for turn over the bedridden patient.
3. Notify by sending message via line notify and alert through buzzer when...
    - The patient presses the call button.
    - The urine collection bag is almost full.
    - It's time to turn over the patient.
4. Display the time remaining to turn patient over on Blynk.

This project applied the use of this following module and use **Blynk(Legacy)** for system control & display. 
- Node MCU Esp8266
- Esp32-CAM **(can replace this with any ip camera which you can get streaming link)**
- Push button 3-5V
- Non contact liquid sensor XKC-Y26V
- Active Buzzer 3-5V
- 5 mm LED (Red)  

***Feel free edit, improve all of project's source code, wire connection and 3D model. I apologize for my documentation that support only Thai language. (= w =)/***
